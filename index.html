    <div id="textsize"><p>
    I am a fourth-year at UC Berkeley, pursuing simultaneous degrees in political science and environmental economics and policy, and a minor in journalism. I have a strong passion for social and environmental justice issues and hope to pursue a career in international environmental law. I grew up in China and can speak Mandarin, English, and French.

    In my free time, I love traveling, hiking, and photography. I started solo-traveling when I was 16 years old.

    <h4> <span>1999 </span>  Born in China </h4>
    <div id="textsize"> I was born at night on July 23, 1999, in Shaanxi Province, China. During the night I was born, the moon was incredibly beautiful, so my parents called me "yueyue," meaning "moon" in Mandarin.<img src="small.jpeg" class="photo-img">

    <h4> <span>2002</span> Moved to Beijing</h4>
    <div id="textsize">When I was three years old, my family moved to Beijing, where I spent most of my time growing up. Although many kids my age were forced to study advanced math, English, or ancient Chinese, my parents were very open-minded. They asked me what I wanted to learn and sent me to piano, painting, dancing, and singing classes. I used to dream of being a pianist like Lang Lang.

    <h4> <span>2008</span> Beijing Olympics </h4>
    <div id="textsize">Many things happened in 2008: financial crisis, Wenchuan Earthquake, and the election of Barack Obama. The biggest event for me was the Beijing Olympics. That year, China was full of energy and hope, as the country opened up to the world. I went to a few Olympic games, including marathon, swimming, and fencing. I was excited to see foreigners in my city and was eager to learn English to communicate with them.

    <h4> <span>2011</span> Middle School </h4>
    <div id="textsize">I went to one of the best middle schools in Beijing, which means I had to attend tutoring classes after school every day in order to do well in weekly exams. My classmates bullied me because my grades weren't good. My teachers did not want to be involved with clubs or Student Union because they thought it was a waste of time. My parents realized Chinese education wasn't the best fit for me, so they decided to send me abroad.

I helped teach math and painting, and I've learned so much from daily interactions with the kids. That experience made me more humble. I hope to help more of these kids in the future.

     <div id="textsize" >My dad gave me his old camera, Canon EOS 5D Mark II, on my 18th birthday. I have brought the camera with me wherever I traveled. I love candid photography, and I enjoy documenting people at their natural moments.

All we need is a pair of eyes that can capture the beauty. </div>
